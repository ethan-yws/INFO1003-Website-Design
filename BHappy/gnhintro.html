<h1 align="center" id="titleHeader"> GNH (Gross National Happiness)</h1>
    <h2>What is GNH ? </h2>
     <p>Gross National Happiness, or GNH, is a holistic and sustainable approach to development, which balances material and non-material values<br><br>
        with the conviction that humans want to search for happiness. The objective of GNH is to achieve a balanced development in all the facets
         of life that<br><br> are essential; for our happiness.
	 </p>
	 <br>
          <h2>Why does GNH matter?</h2>
          <p>We are in the age of the Anthropocene when the fate of the planet and all life is within the power of mankind.<br><br>
            Boundless consumerism amidst widening socio-economic inequality and instability is causing rapid resource depletion and degradation.<br><br>
            Climate change, species extinction, multiple crises, growing insecurity, instability and conflicts are not only diminishing our well-being<br><br>
            but are also threatening our very survival.
<br><br><br>
          GNH directly addresses such global, national and individual challenges by pointing to the non-material roots of well- being and <br><br>
          offering ways to balance and satisfy the dual needs of the human being within the limits of what nature can provide on a sustainable basis.<br><br>
         </p>


     <h2>GNH is based on four 9 dimentions</h2>

		<ul class="dimension">
		 <li class="dimension">Education</li><br>
		  <li class="dimension">Psychological well being</li><br>
		  <li class="dimension">Health</li><br>
		  <li class="dimension">Time-use</li><br>
		  <li class="dimension">Cultural diversity and resilience</li><br>
          <li class="dimension">Good governance</li><br>
		  <li class="dimension">Community vitality</li><br>
		  <li class="dimension">Ecological diversity and resilience</li><br>
		  <li class="dimension">Living standard</li><br>
	    </ul>
				<img class="floating" src="images/fig1gnh.png" />
            <p>These 9 domains, clearly demonstrate that from the<br><br>
 perspective of GNH, many inter-related factors are <br><br>
considered to be important in creating the conditions
 for <br><br>happiness. For example, GNH counts the importance of<br><br> material security
 as one of these � and assessing whether <br><br>people enjoy sufficient
and equitable living standards, is<br><br> included in the GNH survey.
Similarly, the happiness of human<br><br> beings is not
            seen as separate from the wellbeing of other life <br><br>forms, and ecological diversity and
 resilience are included in <br><br>the measure of GNH.
            The balance between material and non-<br><br>material development,
and the multi-dimensional and <br><br>interdependent nature of GNH are key features
 that <br><br>distinguish GNH from GDP as a measure of a country�s<br><br> progress.
          <br><br><br>
            In accordance with these nine domains, Bhutan has developed <br><br>38 sub-indexes, 72 indicators and 151 variables that are used<br> <br>to define and
            analyze the happiness of the Bhutanese people
           </p>
         <h2>There are four pillars to describe the GNH</h2>

	   <ul class="pillars">
	      <li class="pillars">the promotion of sutainable development.</li><br>
		  <li class="pillars">the preservation and promotion of cultural values.</li><br>
		  <li class="pillars">the conseravtion of the natural environment.</li><br>
		  <li class="pillars">the establishment of good governance.</li><br>
	   </ul>
