<h1 align="center" id="titleHeader"> GNH (Gross National Happiness)</h1>
<h2>The Story Of GNH </h2>
 <p>The fourth King inspired by age-old wisdom in the ancient Kingdom of Bhutan concluded that GDP(the existing development paradigm)<br><br>
 was neither an equitable nor a meaningful measurement for human happiness, nor should it be the primary focus for governance; <br><br>
   and thus the philosophy of Gross National Happiness: GNH is born.
   <br><br><br>
  In 2011, the UN unanimously adopted a General Assembly resolution, introduced by Bhutan with support from 68 member states, <br><br>
calling for a �holistic approach to development� aimed at promoting sustainable happiness and wellbeing. This was followed <br><br>
in April 2012 by a UN High-Level Meeting on �Happiness and Wellbeing: Defining a New Economic Paradigm� designed to bring world <br><br>
leaders, experts and civil society and spiritual leaders together to develop a new economic paradigm based on sustainability and<br><br>
 wellbeing. This builds on the Government of Bhutan�s pioneering work to develop the GNH Index.<br><br><br>

  <h2>The History Of GNH</h2>
  <p>In 1972, the King of Bhutan, with the support of the United Nations Development Program, put GNH into practice.<br><br>
 In 1999, the Centre for Bhutan Studies was created, an independent research institute for studying and developing GNH. <br><br>
In 2008, a new Constitution, was adopted by their democratic Parliament.<br><br>
<br><br><br>
In 2006, Adrian White, a psychologist from the University of Leicester, published the World Map of Happiness.<br><br>
 Bhutan ranked 8th, while USA was 23rd. Other large countries with low ranks included: China 82nd, India 125th, Russia 167th.<br><br>
